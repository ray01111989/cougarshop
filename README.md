Assignment 5
This is creating a mockup for the "Cougar Shop", using Semantic UI.
It has Top Menubar• 
The menubar has no borderline in between menu items;
• The social media menu items on the left are tightly grouped together;
• There are some margin spaces on both sides of the menubar;
• The "My Cart" menu item can show a dropdown menu if clicked;
Figure 2: My Cart Dropdown Menu
• The top menubar has no border or shadow;
• The top menubar has a background color (hint: you should use color picker (https:
//imagecolorpicker.com) and the attached mockup image file to find out the exact
color);
Middle Section
• The logo needs to be placed in the center, and has a width "200px";
• The menu items are located in the center;
• Four menu items are dropdown, and each of them shows a specific dropdown menu when
clicked, 
 Footer
The footer of the mockup page has a darker background, recall the approach we used in the
"color block" example in class. Again, you should use color picker (https://imagecolorpicker.
com) and the attached mockup image file to find out the exact color. The requirements for the
footer section are as follows:
• The footer has some padding spaces on top (50px) and at the bottom (50px);
• Create a three column grid, each column has an horizontal rule and a list of items;
• The social media icons are bigger than the ones on the top menu bar, and they are inverted
because the background is dark;
• Create the copyright information at the bottom.
